Reverse engineer the Boost Graph Library adjacency list implementation of a graph.

The graph will be directed, sparse, unweighted, possibly connected, and possibly cyclic.

You must not use new, delete, malloc(), free(), or std::allocator. All memory management must be handled by STL containers.

You also must produce a UML class diagram of the relationships between all of your classes. You can either do this by hand or by using any UML editor of your choice.

10 pts of extra credit if done with a partner using pair programming.
